## Coras Fund White Paper
Cora’s Fund is a unique digital space that raises college tuition funds with digital currency. The initial fund raising mechanism will be through artwork NFT’s being individually sold and/or auctioned off.  The core idea is to create a fundraising platform to raise funds for college tuition through digital means.
